This is my project "0x0B. SSH"
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain the following without any help:


	1. What is a server?
	2. Where servers usually live?
	3. What is SSH?
	4. How to create an SSH RSA key pair?
	5. How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair?
	6. The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash?
