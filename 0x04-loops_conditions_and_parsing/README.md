This is "0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing" poject.
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain the following without the help of Google:

	1. How to create SSH keys.
	2. What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash.
	3. How to use while, until and for loops.
	4. How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements.
	5. How to use the cut command.
	6. What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them.
